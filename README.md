# IT_360_Project_1
The goal of this project is to create a ML model that will detect phishing emails as well as spam emails.

To do this, we downloaded a .csv file with 200 sample emails labeled phishing 1 for phishing and 0 for safe. For the spam we will do a similar process flow, implement a labeled .csv list from an online source to train our ML model on and verify its detection rates. 

A successful outcome is the ML bot determining with 80% accuracy a fishing or spam email
